NlpParse.synopsis = Creates a natural language parse tree.
NlpParse.description = Returns a natural language parse tree of the given text. \
This tree represents the grammatical structure of the text. 
NlpParse.sentence = the sentence to parse.
NlpParse.parse_tree = a list that represents the parse tree.
NlpParse.FileNotFoundException = when the specified model file is not found.

NlpLemmatize.synopsis = Gets the lemma of a word.
NlpLemmatize.description = Returns the lemma (canonical form) of the specified \
word and POS tag.
NlpLemmatize.word = the word which lemma is to be obtained.
NlpLemmatize.pos = the POS (part of speech) tag corresponding to the word.
NlpLemmatize.lemma = the lemma of the specified word. When that word is \
not found in the dictionary the same word is returned. 
NlpLemmatize.FileNotFoundException = when the specified model file is not found.

NlpSentences.synopsis = Splits text into sentences.
NlpSentences.description = Returns a list that contains the sentences of the \
specified text.
NlpSentences.text = the text to split into sentences.
NlpSentences.sentences = a list of sentences (strings).
NlpSentences.FileNotFoundException = when the specified model file is not found.

NlpTokenize.synopsis = Extracts tokens from text.
NlpTokenize.description = Returns a list that contains the tokens (strings) \
of the specified text.
NlpTokenize.text = the text to split into tokens.
NlpTokenize.tokens = a list of tokens (strings).
NlpTokenize.FileNotFoundException = when the specified model file is not found.

parser_model_path = the path to the parser model file. When no specified, \
<parser_model_path> is assumed to be <${user.home}/en-parser-chunking.bin>.\n\
See <http://opennlp.apache.org> documentation for more details.
tokenizer_model_path = the path to the tokenizer model file. \
When no specified, <tokenizer_model_path> is assumed to be \
<${user.home}/en-token.bin>.\nWhen <tokenizer_model_path> is an empty string a \
whitespace tokenizer will be used.
sentence_model_path = the path to the sentence detector model file. \
When no specified, <sentence_model_path> is assumed to be \
<${user.home}/en-sent.bin>.\nWhen <sentence_model_path> is an empty string a \
newline sentence detector will be used.
dict_path = the path to the dictionary lemmatizer file. \
When no specified, <dict_path> is assumed to be \
<${user.home}/en-lemmatizer.dict>.\nWhen <dict_path> is an empty string no \
lemmatization will be performed.
