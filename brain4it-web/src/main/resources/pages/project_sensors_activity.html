    <h1>Sensors activity</h1>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <div class="box">
      <p>
        <a href="http://sentilo.io">Sentilo</a> is an open source sensor
        and actuator platform designed to fit in the Smart City architecture
        of any city looking for openness and easy interoperability.
        This platform provides a simple
        <a href="http://www.sentilo.io/xwiki/bin/view/APIDocs/WebHome">HTTP REST API</a>
        to manage sensory data.
      </p>
      <p>
        The city of Sant Feliu de Llobregat uses Sentilo to publish
        the data of their sensors. They decide to develope this Braint4it module
        to detect which sensors have stopped sending data to the platform.
        This information is provided in two different ways:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>An email is sent to the user to report that a sensor is failing</li>
        <li>The dashboard of the module has a
          display that shows the IDs of the sensors that are failing.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The following diagram illustrates the functioning of the system:</p>

    <h2>Programming the module</h2>
    <div class="box">
      <p>
        This module has been programmed using the timer functions.
        The use of these functions is very appropriate to execute repetitive tasks 
        because they do not consume an executor thread permanently.</p>
      
      <p>When the module is started, the code contained in the
        <span class="code">start</span> variable <code>(spawn (eval main))</code> is evaluated.</p>
      <p>This code schedules a sensor checking function to be 
        executed every <span class="code">access_interval_msec</span> milliseconds:
      </p>
      <div class="code">
        <code>
          (timer-schedule
            (function
             ()
             (try
              (do
               (### "Calculates time_reference, checks sensors")
               (%soft_reset-sensors-failing)
               (%soft_calculate-reference-timestamp)
               (%soft_check-sensors)
               (set variables/active true)
              )
             (ex
               "*" =>
               (do
                 (### "When an error takes place, it is saved in a variable named 'error'")
                 (set error (list (format-date (date)) ex))
               )
             )
           )
          )
          0
          variables/access_interval_msec
          )
        </code>
      </div>
      <p>The scheduled function performs the following tasks:</p>
      <p>First cleans the list containing the ID's of
        the sensors that were failing the in last iteration.
        After that, a new reference time is calculated as the
        difference between the current date and the access interval for
        checking the sensor values. This reference time will be used later in order
        to decide whether the sensors are working properly or not.</p>
      <p>Next step is checking the sensors.
        New values are obtained and evaluated. For each sensor value Sentilo also
        provides the timestamp of its publication. If that timestamp
        is older than the previously calculated reference time, then we assume that
        the sensor is failing and include it in the list of failing sensors.
        Those sensors without information are considered as if they were
        broken down too.</p>
      <p>Failing sensors list is showed in the dashboard and
        an email is sent to the user by calling this function:
      </p>      
      <div class="code">
        <code>
          (function (sensor_id sensor_provider)
          (###
          "This fuction sends an email to the selected direction in order to inform about the incidence"
          )
          (smtp
          "host" => setup/host
          "port" => setup/port
          "from" => setup/from
          "to" => variables/to
          "subject" => (concat setup/subject sensor_id)
          "body" =>
          (concat
          setup/body
          "\n"
          "Provider: "
          sensor_provider
          "\n"
          "Sensor ID: "
          sensor_id
          )
          )
          )
        </code>
      </div>
      <p>The message that the user receives contains a brief description of the problem:</p>
      <img src="projects/sensors_activity/email.png" alt="" class="image">
      <p>
        The dashboard of the module gives the user the option of choosing the access interval
        and the email receiver. Every time the interval is changed the checking function is scheduled again:
      </p>
      <div class="code">
        <code>
          (function
          (%soft_header data)
          (### "Sets the value in the 'range' widget")
          (set variables/access_interval data)
          (%soft_calculate-access-interval-sec data)
          (%soft_calculate-access-interval-msec variables/access_interval_sec)
          (if
          variables/active
          (do
          (timer-cancel)
          (eval main)
          )
          )
          (module-notify "@get-access-interval")
          )
        </code>
      </div>

      <img src="projects/sensors_activity/dashboard.png" alt="" class="image">
      <p>
        When the module is stopped, the <span class="code">stop</span> variable is evaluated
        and the scheduled task is cancelled.
      </p>
      <p>The module configuration parameters (Sentilo properties, sensors to verify, etc.) are hold in the
        <span class="code">setup</span> list.
