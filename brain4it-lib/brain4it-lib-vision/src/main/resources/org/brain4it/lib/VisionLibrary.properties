StartVideoServer.synopsis = Starts a video server.
StartVideoServer.description = Starts a video server on the specified port. \
It will serve the image from the given camera at the specified resolution in \
MJPEG format (Motion JPEG).
StartVideoServer.port = the port to listen for connections.
StartVideoServer.camera = the name of the camera to select. If not specified, \
the default camera of the system is selected.
StartVideoServer.resolution = the name of the resolution to use \
(QVGA, VGA, SVGA, HD, FHD, etc).
StartVideoServer.result = a message indicating the listening port and camera \
resolution of the server. It will be null if the server can not be started.

StopVideoServer.synopsis = Stops a video server.
StopVideoServer.description = Stops the video server running on the \
specified port.
StopVideoServer.port = the port where the server is listening for connections.
StopVideoServer.result = a message indicating that the server was stopped. \
It will be null if the server can not be stopped.

VideoCameras.synopsis = List the video cameras available in the system.
VideoCameras.description = Retuns a list that contains for each available \
camera a sublist describing its features.
VideoCameras.name = the name of the camera.
VideoCameras.device = the camera device description.
VideoCameras.fps = the maximum frames per second supported by the camera.
VideoCameras.resolution = a supported camera resolution.
VideoCameras.width = the width in pixels of the resolution.
VideoCameras.height = the height in pixels of the resolution.

VisionFiducials.synopsis = Detects fiducials of an image. 
VisionFiducials.description = This function returns a list of all fiducials \
detected in the given image. For each of these fiducials, the fiducial id, \
its position and orientation are provided.
VisionFiducials.url = the url of the image to process. If <url> do not start \
with a protocol scheme (*://), <url> is assumed to be a path in the \
local file system.
VisionFiducials.width = the width in pixels of the processed image.
VisionFiducials.height = the height in pixels of the processed image.
VisionFiducials.camera_parameters = the camera parameters.
VisionFiducials.detection = a fiducial detection data structure.
VisionFiducials.id = the id that encodes the fiducial.
VisionFiducials.ox = the x coordinate in pixels of the origin of the fiducial.
VisionFiducials.oy = the y coordinate of pixels of the origin of the fiducial.
VisionFiducials.x = the x coordinate of the axis.
VisionFiducials.y = the y coordinate of the axis.
VisionFiducials.nx = the x coordinate of the normal vector of the fiducial.
VisionFiducials.ny = the y coordinate of the normal vector of the fiducial.
VisionFiducials.nz = the z coordinate of the normal vector of the fiducial.
VisionFiducials.cx = the <CameraPinhole.cx> (see <http://boofcv.org>).
VisionFiducials.cy = the <CameraPinhole.cy> (see <http://boofcv.org>).
VisionFiducials.fx = the <CameraPinhole.fx> (see <http://boofcv.org>).
VisionFiducials.fy = the <CameraPinhole.fy> (see <http://boofcv.org>).
