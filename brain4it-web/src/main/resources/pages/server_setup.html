      <h1>Server setup</h1>

      <h2>Standalone based servers</h2>

      <div class="box">
        <p>The <strong>standalone</strong>, <strong>raspberrypi</strong> and <strong>swing</strong> 
          servers are packaged as a zip file that contains scripts 
          (under the <span class="code">bin</span> directory) to start an stop the server.
        </p>
        <p>
          When these servers are started they take the configuration parameters 
          from the file located in <span class="code">conf/server.properties</span>.
        </p>        
        <p>The parameters that can be set in this file are the following:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><span class="code">port</span>: the TCP port through which the server will accept connections. 
            The port by default is <span class="code">9999</span>.</li>
          <li><span class="code">shutdownFile</span>: the path of the shutdown file. 
            When this file is specified, the server creates it on startup and shuts down when it is removed.</li>
          <li><span class="code">multiTenant</span>: a boolean (<span class="code">true</span> or <span class="code">false</span>) 
            that enables the multi-tenant mode. By default <span class="code">multiTenant</span> is <span class="code">false</span>.</li>        
          <li><span class="code">accessKey</span>: the server access key. That key grants access to all modules in the server. 
            By default its value is null and the server is unprotected.</li>
          <li><span class="code">accessKeyFile</span>: the path of the access key file used in multi-tenant mode. 
            That file is a Java properties file that contains for each tenant its server access key (<span class="code">tenant=accessKey</span>).</li>
          <li><span class="code">libraries</span>: a comma separated string that contains the name of the libraries to load at startup.
            By default, only <span class="code">Core</span> and <span class="code">Module</span> libraries are loaded.</li>
          <li><span class="code">keyStoreFile</span>: the path of the key store file to enable secure server connections.</li>
          <li><span class="code">keyStoreType</span>: the type of the key store file. By default that type is <span class="code">PKCS12</span>.</li>
          <li><span class="code">keyStorePass</span>: the key store password.</li>
          <li><span class="code">keyPass</span>: the key password.</li>
          <li><span class="code">sslProtocol</span>: the secure sockets layer protocol. By default <span class="code">sslProtocol</span> is <span class="code">TLS</span>.</li>
          <li><span class="code">storeClass</span>: the full Java class name of the server store. 
            By default <span class="code">storeClass</span> is <span class="code long">org.brain4it.server.store.FileSystemStore.</span></li>     
          <li><span class="code">basePath</span>: the path where the <span class="code">FileSystemStore</span> will save the module data.
            By default that path is <span class="code">System.getProperty("user.home") + "/brain4it_modules"</span></li>        
          <li><span class="code">maxWaitTime</span>: the maximum number of seconds to wait for a result in a POST call (command execution or exterior function invocation). 
            By default its value is <span class="code">300</span> seconds (5 minutes).</li>
          <li><span class="code">monitorMaxWaitTime</span>: the maximum number of seconds to wait for an exterior function to return a value in a monitoring session. 
            By default its value is <span class="code">10</span> seconds.</li>          
          <li><span class="code">monitorPingTime</span>: the time in seconds between two consecutive ping messages sent to the client. 
            Ping messages are sent to check if connection has been closed.
            By default <span class="code">monitorPingTime</span> is <span class="code">30</span> seconds.
            See <a href="rest_api.html#watch_exterior_functions">Watch exterior functions</a> for more details.</li>
          <li><span class="code">keepAliveTime</span>: the maximum time in seconds that the server will keep an 
            idle socket open in HTTP persistent connections. By default <span class="code">keepAliveTime</span> is 5 seconds.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="advanced">
          To load an additional library on these servers copy its jar file (and others it depends on) in the 
          <span class="code">lib</span> directory of the server and add the library name to the <span class="code">libraries</span> 
          property of <span class="code">conf/server.properties</span> file.
