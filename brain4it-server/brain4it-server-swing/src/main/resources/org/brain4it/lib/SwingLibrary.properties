Paint.synopsis = Paint graphic primitives on screen.
Paint.description = This function paints the graphic primitives passed as \
arguments. If primitives are omitted, the screen is cleared.
Paint.primitive = A list representing a graphic primitive to paint on screen. \
The first element is a string that indicates the type of the primitive. The \
rest of the elements in the list are the primitive parameters. The supported \
primitives are: ("group" "offset-x" => offset-x "offset-y" => offset-y \
"rotation" => rotation), ("line" x1 y1 x2 y2), ("text" text x y), \
("image" url x y [width height]), ("rectangle" x y width height) \
and ("circle" x y radius). "group" primitives can contain other graphic \
primitives. The next styling properties can be set for most primitives: \
"color", "font-family", "font-size", "line-width". \
These properties are inherited by children primitives.
Paint.scene = The primitive tree that is painted on screen.
