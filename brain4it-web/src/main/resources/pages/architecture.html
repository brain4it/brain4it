      <h2>General diagram</h2>
      <div class="box">
        <p>This is the general diagram of the Brain4it architechure:</p>

          <div class="info">
            <ul>
              <li>The <strong>Brain4it server</strong> is a software that can run on a 
                wide varity of devices like computers, smartphones, raspberry robots, etc.
              It implements the logic that make these devices behave smartly. 
              That logic is programmed in BPL (Brain4it Programming Language), a 
              simple but powerfull language specially designed to develop 
              expert systems and other AI applications.
              It runs on top of a Java VM and has access to:
              <ul>
                <li>External services like messaging systems, sensor/actuator platforms, web services, etc.</li>
                <li>Hardware resources of the device like GPIO (General Purpose Input Ouput) pins, 
                sensors, serial ports, camera, audio, screen, etc.</li>
                <li>Other Brain4it servers, with which it can cooperate.</li>
              </ul>
              </li>
              <li>The <strong>Brain4it manager</strong> is the program that allows 
                the user to interact with the server. It has tools to program the 
                server logic and control its operation through the HTTP REST API. 
                There are 3 manager apps available: for desktop computers, android devices and web browsers.</li>
              <li>3rd. party applications can also comunicate with the server through the same HTTP REST API 
                to read or write information or invoke a module function.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

      <h2>The server</h2>

      <div class="box">       
        <p>The server is the "brain" of the device. It is organized in modules, 
          where each module implements a specific task and do not shares data with others.</p> 
        <div class="diagram p35">
          <div class="image">
            <img src="images/server_components.svg" style="width:300px" alt="server components">
          </div>
          <div class="info">
            <p>Internally, the server has 3 components:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>The <strong>RestService</strong> implements a simple HTTP REST interface to read and write module data, invoke functions and
                manage the server modules. See the <a href="rest_api.html">HTTP REST API documentation</a> for more information.</li>
              <li>The <strong>ModuleManager</strong> performs all the module management operations: 
                list, create, load, save, destroy, start and stop modules.
                Some of these operations are exposed through the REST API while others can be invoked through 
                the functions of the <a href="library_module.html">Module library</a>.
                The ModuleManager also manages the libraries that are loaded at server startup. Each library contains a
                set of built-in functions that allow you to perform different tasks. 
              </li>
              <li>The <strong>Store</strong> is responsible of saving the module snapshots in persistent storage. 
                The default implementation, saves these snapshots in the underlying filesystem.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Currently exists 5 versions of the Brain4it server:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Standalone server</strong>: it is a lightweight server implementation intented for devices with few resources.</li>
              <li><strong>Server for web containers (J2EE)</strong>: it is a server implementation designed to run in a J2EE web container like 
              Tomcat or Jetty.</li>
              <li><strong>Raspberry server</strong>: based on the standalone server, it incorporates functions to access the
              Raspberry Pi hardware (GPIO pins, serial ports, etc...).</li>
              <li><strong>Android server</strong>: also based on the standalone server, it offers functions to access the Android device 
              hardware and software resources (sensors, GPS, text to speech, etc...)</li>
              <li><strong>Swing server</strong>: it is a standalone server with a screen attached to it where you can 
                draw graphic primitives, text and images. This server is tyically used as a smart information point.
              </li>
            </ul>

      <h2>The manager</h2>

      <div class="box">
        <p>The manager is an application that allows the user to program and control the Brain4it server remotelly 
          through its HTTP REST API.</p> 
        <p>The are currently 3 versions available of the manager application:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Desktop</strong>: Java swing application for desktop computers running on Windows, Linux or MacOS.</li>
          <li><strong>Android</strong>: Native android application for android 4.1 and above.</li>
          <li><strong>Web</strong>: html5 responsive application that can run on all devices.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>All these managers offer the following tools:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Workspace manager</strong>: allows to setup a group of servers and manage its modules.</li>
          <li><strong>Console</strong>: interactive console to execute commands in a module.</li>
          <li><strong>Editor</strong>: smart text editor to program code or edit data.</li>
          <li><strong>Dashboard</strong>: control panel with buttons, leds, gauges and other widgets to send orders to the server
            and monitor its internal state.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In addition to these tools, the Desktop version also incorporates the <strong>Dashboard designer</strong>, a 
          visual tool to create control panels in few minutes.</p>
