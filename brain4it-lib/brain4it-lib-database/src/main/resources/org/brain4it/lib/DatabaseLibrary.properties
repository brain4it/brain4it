DatabaseConnect.username = the username to establish the connection.
DatabaseConnect.password = the user's password.
DatabaseConnect.auto_commit = when true, the current transaction is committed \
after each call to <db-execute> function. By default its value is false.
DatabaseConnect.SQLException = when a connection to the database can not be \
established.

DatabaseDisconnect.synopsis = Closes a database connection.
DatabaseDisconnect.description = Closes the given database connection.
DatabaseDisconnect.closed = true if the connection was closed or false otherwise.

is a change statement (INSERT, UPDATE or DELETE) this function \
will return the number of rows that were modified.
DatabaseExecute.result = a list containing the data returned by the \
SELECT statement or the number of rows modified by the sql statement.
DatabaseExecute.sql = the sql statement to execute. It can be any statement \
supported by the JDBC driver. The statement can contain parameters \
represented by brackets. The value inside the brackets is the name of the \
parameter.
DatabaseExecute.parameters = a list containing the values of the parameters of \
