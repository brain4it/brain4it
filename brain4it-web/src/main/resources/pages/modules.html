            <p>A Brain4it <strong>module</strong> is an application than runs inside a Brain4it server.</p>
            <p>Important things you need to know about modules:</p>   
            <ul>
              <li>Manager applications allow you to create and destroy a module
                through the <a href="rest_api.html">REST API</a> of a Brain4it server. 
                The <strong>server access key</strong> is required to perform these operations. 
                See the <a href="server_setup.html">server setup</a> to find out how to change the server access key.        
              </li>
              <li>A module has a unique name within the server.</li>
              <li>It contains the code and data (lists and literals) of the application.</li>
              <li>Its content is isolated from other modules.</li>
              <li>All elements inside a module (lists and literals) can be referenced by a URL.</li>
              <li>The HTTP GET, PUT and DELETE methods of the <a href="rest_api.html">REST API</a> of a Brain4it server 
                allow you to read, write and delete any content of the module. 
                To call these methods the <strong>module access key</strong> (or server access key) must be specified in the <span class="code">Access-Key</span> request header. 
                If no access key is specified, the module content can not be read or modified. The value of the module access key is defined by the
                <code>access-key</code> variable.</li>
              <li>A module may have <strong>exterior function</strong>s that expose some functionality of the application. 
                These functions are easily recognizable because their name starts with the at symbol (@).
                No access key is required to invoke an exterior function, but it may implement other security mechanisms instead (like basic authentication).</li>
              <li>The values returned by exterior functions can be monitored efficiently through the <a href="rest_api.html#watch_exterior_functions">REST API</a>.</li>
              <li>A module could have one o more <strong>dashboard</strong>s. A dashboard is a user interface that contains widgets 
                (like buttons, sliders, displays, etc.) to show information or send orders to the module by calling its external functions. 
                See the <a href="dashboards.html">dashboard design guide</a> to learn how to create a dashboard.</li>
              <li><strong>Snapshot</strong>s of the module content can be generated and saved in persistent storage with the <code>module-save</code> function.                
                These snapshots can be loaded into the module memory with the <code>module-load</code> function. 
                Consult the <a href="library_module.html">module library</a> to know more about these functions.<br>
                Each snapshot has a unique name within the module. By default that name is "head".<br>
                When the server is stopped, all its modules are saved automatically as the "head" snapshot.
                When the server is started again, all its modules are loaded with the content of its "head" snapshot.
              </li>
              <li>The desktop manager application can import and export module snapshots represented as text files. 
                These snapshots can be imported later into modules of the same or other servers.</li>
              <li>When a module is started (at server startup), the code of the <code>start</code> variable is evaluated 
                to perform initialization tasks.</li>
              <li>When a module is stopped (at server shutdown), the code of the <code>stop</code> variable 
                is evaluated to perform cleanup tasks. After that, any running executor in this module is interrupted.</li>
            </ul>
